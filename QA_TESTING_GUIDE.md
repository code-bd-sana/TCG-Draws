## 🛠️ Phase 1: Environment & Test Setup Preparation

Before executing test cases, prepare your environment and seed test accounts.

### 1.1 Environment Setup (`.env`)
Ensure your `backend/.env` contains the following active keys:

```env
# Server & DB
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://fairway_draw_test:2E5kvUm$2b@localhost:5432/fairway_draw_test"
JWT_SECRET="super-secret-key-change-in-production"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Cashflows Integration
CASHFLOWS_CONFIGURATION_ID="260826100033554432"
CASHFLOWS_API_KEY="48dc6700-eb4f-4d3f-940d-8a3f750137d4"
CASHFLOWS_BASE_URL="https://gateway-int.cashflows.com"
USE_TEST_PAYMENT="false" # Set "true" for instant test mode, "false" for live Cashflows Gateway redirect
```

### 1.2 Database Seeding Commands
Run the provided seeds in `backend/` to populate test categories, subscription plans, and baseline accounts:
```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:seed # Runs seeds for active categories, plans, and demo accounts
```

### 1.3 Baseline Test Accounts Matrix
| Account Role | Test Email | Default Password | Initial State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin@gmail.com` | `admin@gmail.com` | Active, System Control |
| **Host (Verified)** | `host@gmail.com` | `host@gmail.com` | `isVerified = true`, Active `Pro` Plan, £150 Wallet |
| **Client/User** | `client@gmail.com` | `client@gmail.com` | Email Verified, Active |

## 💼 Phase 3: Host Onboarding, Admin Approval & Subscription Flow Testing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Host Account Lifecycle**:
> 1. Host Registers → `HostProfile.isVerified = false` (Pending Approval).
> 2. Host Login Lockout → Login fails with `"Your host account is pending admin approval."` until Admin approves.
> 3. Admin Approves → Admin clicks **Approve Host** in Admin Dashboard (`PATCH /api/v1/admin/hosts/:id/approve`), setting `isVerified = true`.
> 4. Host Login & Subscription → Host can now log in, select a plan (`Premium` or `Pro`), and complete Cashflows payment.
