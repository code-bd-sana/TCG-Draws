              <p>
                All items offered as prizes must be exactly as described in the competition listing. If an item is second-hand or has minor defects, this must be stated explicitly. All golf equipment, apparel, and merchandise must be 100% authentic, verified, and safely packaged for delivery.

                All main draws must be conducted live using a verifiable third-party random number generator (e.g., Google Random Number Generator). Screen sharing must be active during the draw, and recordings must be retained for at least 30 days.
